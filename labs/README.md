This program will present data generated through the file data.csv, of cars from within a car show, ranking their scores amoungst each other in descending order. All output will be sent over to a seperate file which will list the tops 3 of groups: rank, car_id, year, car make, car modle, and total score. The program will be executed by a make file all at once as a means to automate execution of the awk file.
