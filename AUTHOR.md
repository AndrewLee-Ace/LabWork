My name is Andrew Lee and I am a senior attending Brooklyn College since Fall of 2019. My current major is Computer Science and I made this decision pretty much before I had actually entered college. I've always known that I wanted to create things, I began loving to creating things physically but over time my interest in coding became sort of a passion that I enjoy creating now.
I'd love for my college career to take off at some point into a job or even an internship and am looking forward for the new opportunities out there. I'm hoping to get into a software engineering job or even working front end, backend, or even full stack; I've also looked into becoming a contractor. Some of my hobbies actually consist of you won't believe it, coding, I actually love to cook, and I love to work in my garden.
